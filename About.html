        <h2>Join Us Today!</h2>
        <p>Today, my little shop is run entirely online. Every donut is a virtually handmade and delivered to</p>
        <p>you. You can order as many donuts as you like and we will always provide you with excellent</p>
        <p>service and deliciousness in every <strong>Byte</strong>.</p>

        <h2><br/>About the original owner</h2>
        <h4><strong>SSG. Fredrick Davis</strong></h4>
        <p>This shop hasn't always been virtual. Up until recently, the <em>Delicious Donut Depot</em> was owned by</p>
        <p>a retired US Army Staff Sergeant named Fred Davis. He ran the shop single-handedly in a small</p>
        <p>town in Georgia. Once he decided that he was too old to be slinging the best donuts in the</p>
        <p>world, he knew it was time to pass his business on to a fellow Veteran. SSG. Davis gave me his</p>
        <p>shop under the stipulation that I bring it into the virtual world.</p>
        <p><br /><strong>So here we are...</strong></p>
